Probably Nothing. Every week we showcase growing trends in web3 and crypto.\n\n\nWhat's on the block:\n\n\n🤑 FTX announces it's monster revenue\n\n⛓ Tornado Cash lead contributors arrested globally\n\n🏎 web3 gaming is happening, but it's not what you think\n\n🏆 Top 3 funding rounds\n\n💎 Nike & Tiffany billion dollar opportunity\n\n🦸🏻‍♂️ How Marvel, Disney & DC are entering NFTs\n\n\n😳 FTX grows 1000% in revenue.\n\nThis week FTX it leaked that FTX grew over 1000% in revenue which was pretty much confirmed by SBF in 2021, will be interesting to see those 22’ numbers.\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * ~15% of revenue is on marketing\n * FTX US only makes up 5% of FTX overall revenue\n * 2/3 of it’s $270m in revenue in Q22 was done from futures trading fees\n * $388m net income in 2021\n\nDYOR: It's stands that FTX still makes considerable amount of money from OTC and institutional trading. It's interesting to see the small amount that FTX US has to play in its overall revenue as a company that is probably made up in brand and trust. Full article in this piece from CNBC here.\n\n\n🌪 Tornado Cash sanctioned by U.S Treasury\n\nTornado cash was sanction by the U.S Treasury resulting in their codebase being removed from Github.\n\n * One of the key contributors to the repo was reported arrested in the Netherlands for their implication in the codebase.\n * Several high profile companies and influencer wallets also got restricted from protocols like Aave, Uniswap and Balancer\n * Trolls are transferring from the tornado contract to protest the sanction efforts and troll public wallets\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\nWe can see that countries are starting to take action on their stance on crypto. Because understanding regulation provides more stability than uncertainty.\n\nDYOR: Highly recommend checking out a16z podcast with Michele Korver, head of regulatory at a16z crypto & Jai Ramaswamy, chief legal officer at Andreessen Horowitz as they deep dive on the future of regulation and crypto policy.\n\nCheck out the full coverage by the block.\n\n\n🏎 Web3 Gaming ft. Paradigm CTF\n\nParadigm a leading crypto venture fund launched its Capture the Flag (CTF) competition for security researchers and degens last weekend. A series of exploit, loophole and speed focused challenges.\n\nIt’s highlight was a on-chain player vs player (pvp) racing game called 0xMonaco, fans of F1 rejoice the chaos that ensued was just like its namesake track off the coast of the Mediterranean. A back and forth epic of last minute losers, winners and upsets.\n\nIt focused around core concepts of game theory and pvp, you can read the full ruleset here if you’re interested. It's geeky Mario Kart.\n\n * You purchase acceleration or a shell to reduce acceleration of who's in front immediately to 0, the price is determined by the market\n * You have 15k coins to make purchases, the price is determined by supply/demand in the race\n * Be first place by the end of the race\n\nHere's a breakdown on exactly how the strategies played out on race day:\n\n * teamSnake took out 2nd place and broke down their strategy in their blog post here\n * onemanbandplus2 broke the game so bad the devs actually had to do something. You can read how they broke 0xMonaco here\n\nProbably nothing?\n\n * 0xMonaco has shown us that crypto gaming can often take interesting forms and also create opportunity for new innovation in web3\n * Security is an extremely important part to a safe decentralised world as billions continue to be lost in bridge hacks and insecure contracts\n\n\n💰👀 Funding\n\n\n🕸 Thirdweb\n\nThirdweb raised $24m @ $160m valuation from Haun ventures with participation from Coinbase and Shopify. It's web3 infrastructure suite to deploy pre-made smart contracts and governance control.\n\nThirdweb was founded by Steve Bartlett (Dragon’s Den, co-founder of Social Chain ETR: PU11) & Furqan Rydhan (co-founder App Lovin, Bebo).\n\nProbably nothing?\n\n * Created a marketplace to deploy popular contracts in 1-click and plans to allow developers to sell audited contracts on their platform\n * Strong combination of SDK for developers and no-code tools\n * The first public web3 investment from Shopify\n\n\n🍊 Orange DAO\n\nOrange DAO closed a $80m fund to continue to invest in YC and YC alumni creating companies in the web3 space. The DAO which is a seperate entity from the fund is made up of 1,300 members all from YC companies that help in due diligence and sourcing.\n\nProbably nothing?\n\n * Great example of community focused investing that has led to a great community\n * Portfolio track record is showing great promise\n * A derivative approach to a extremely strong existing IP that is Y combinator\n\n\n📈 Ultimate.Finance\n\nUltimate raised $12.4m from Lightspeed for its yield focused mobile DeFi wallet.\n\nProbably nothing?\n\n * UX friendly approach to crypto similar to the e-toro model for traditional finance\n * Bundling a web3 degen’s toolkit, bringing it into a mobile first platform\n * Early investment from Lightspeed’s new crypto fund announced apart of their $7.1b in new capital last month\n\n\n💎 The future is Mint Tiffany Blue\n\n\nThis week we look at the traditional retail and its efforts to break into web3.\n\nBrands are entering the space left and right over the course of the last 18 months, but how successful are these collaborations and launches?\n\nWe can see the big winner so far is Nike with $183.69m in revenue through primary ($93.10m) and secondary transactions ($90.59m). With brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Tiffany and Gucci following suit.\n\nWe’ve seen brands take a couple of different approaches to dipping their toes in the web3 space with Nike being the most aggressive acquiring web3 design studio RTFKT (Art-ti-fact) a couple days after their successful Clone X launch.\n\nWhile other brands have taken a collaboration approach with Tiffany recently selling out of their punks necklace collection in 20 minutes. Only claimable from owning the respective punk and for 30eth (~$48k) at time of sale.\n\nProbably nothing?\n\n * Early results can show us is people are willing to spend money in this market. While Nike’s web3 profits make up only ~0.38% of Nike’s overall global revenue\n * Secondary revenue and royalty is much more important. Nike missed out on the $10b secondary sneaker market in 2020\n * We're entering era where IP franchises like games, shows and merchandise will make on break projects\n\n\n🔧 Sudoswap: What a tool\n\nSudoswap continues to turn heads as a marketplace with the continued discussion around perpetual royalties coming into question for NFT projects.\n\nIt also enters as Opensea volume reaches a record low. Earlier this month Looksrare volume surpassed Opensea for the first time as its volume drops 99% from its ATH.\n\nWhat is Sudoswap? Sudoswap and it’s SudoAMM is a new marketplace protocol that features fully on-chain liquidity pools for NFTs rather than stand alone listings similar to how Uniswap exists currently.\n\nProbably nothing?\n\n * A great step to further drive decentralisation in NFT markets\n * Opensea and other marketplaces have royalties at a marketplace level in the seaport contract, however platforms like sudoswap mint at the collection contract level, bypassing royalties set by these marketplaces and leaving creators behind.\n * Active users (7 day) at 1.3k, however the majority of its users are participating in low floor pools, in what looks like an effort to farm activity for a potential airdrop\n\nDYOR -

Probably Nothing. Every week we showcase growing trends in web3 and crypto.\n\nWith the merge this month we are doing a 2 part special edition! Back to your weekly scheduled programming next week.\n\n\nWhat's on the block:\n\n\n⛓ Red Notice issued for Do Kwon's arrest\n\n😅 A protocol accidentally alt + f4'd their chain\n\n📈 Reddit NFTs are doing surprisingly well\n\n🤑 Advertisement King Pin land $200m for NFT project\n\n🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Trust & safety is 🗝 to the first billion users in web3\n\n🛠 Getting you hooked, the best new tool for devs\n\n🔥 Special Edition: The Merge\n\n\n👮🏼‍♀️ Interpol is after the Luna Co-Founder  \n\nNo Ryan Reynolds here. It seems the lunacy still hasn't reached its final chapter as Coindesk and multiple news sources state that Interpol has put out a Red Notice for Do Kwon's arrest. This effectively means that any police force in the world has the right to arrest and extradite the Luna co-founder. The Singapore authorities however say Do Kwon isn't at his home in the country.  \n\nDYOR\n\n * Coin telegraph says that Do Kwon tried to cash out $67m after the crash\n * Coinage has an exclusive 70-minute interview with Do Kwon last month on the Tera collapse\n\n\n😳 Optifi accidentally alt + F4 their mainnet\n\nAccidently taking down production isn't a new thing in development and usually not something a restart and a well-time PR article cannot fix. However, in Defi it can mean losing your funds forever.\n\n * Automated market maker Optifi Labs accidentally used the close program command on their solana-based application\n * The funds are locked in the Program Derived Address (PDA) that is closed\n * $661k USDC was lost, 95% of the funds are from a team member\n * All users' funds lost will be compensated\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * An expensive lesson and they are largely a new company that started experimenting with their own funds.\n * In their press release, they also released some great Command-Line Interface (CLI) recommendations for Solana to stop this from happening in the future.\n\nDYOR\n\nOptifi did a good job DYOR themselves on this so I'll just leave their tweet here for everyone to learn from going forward.\n\n\n🥵 Are Reddit NFTs working?\n\nReddit quietly entered the NFT market over the last year however it's seeing mixed results. Their original Crypto Snoo led off with a bang last year with the highest fetching a price of 115eth to Kraken Co-founder Jesse Powell.\n\nLet's talk about Reddit's cryptocurrency $MOONS and Reddit NFTs.\n\n$Moons is the native cryptocurrency token isolated currently to the r/cryptocurrency subreddit which currently has 5.4m members.\n\n * Currently has a fully diluted market cap of $29.2m with a fixed max supply for 250m $MOONS\n * Moons are distributed every 28 days based on total karma earned during a timeframe. Reddit's version of contribution and popularity of content/comments from a user or Competitions\n * It was originally launched purely on Rinkeby but now it's migrated to the Abitrum L2 Nova network\n * Any special features outside of NFT avatars for Moons are currently isolated to the r/CryptoCurrency Subreddit\n\n\nThe first initial free airdrop collaboration featured Meme Team, Drip Squad, Aww Friends and The Singularity which we're airdropped for free to active contributors. The current prices of these are around $10-$100.\n\nThere are continuously new paid collaborations being released with some fetching high prices that can be purchased with Moons or Fiat.\n\n * B•E•N•O•T•A•F•R•A•I•D had 777 pieces and mint #1 sold for 8.5 ETH\n * The Hands another small collection had 100 limited pieces and #002 sold for 15 ETH this week\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * The 'minimal' $10-$30 prices the free NFT airdrops are selling for, is more than some Redditors' monthly incomes. Win! A great intro into crypto for Reddit's ecosystem of users\n * Is the power of a Reddit avatar worth more than just using a regular NFT as your Reddit avatar?\n * Reddit keeping verification of NFTs to their own collections on profiles is a powerful distribution method for their ecosystem\n\n\n🐙 Slaying the Kraken - Jesse Powell steps down\n\nJesse Powell Co-founder of Kraken one of the world's largest crypto exchanges announced his stepping down as CEO this week to focus on advocacy for US crypto policy.\n\nThe ocean has been coming to a boil at Kraken over the last couple of months, last quarter the company came out with a 31-page culture document defining its commitment to diversity of thought.\n\nEncouraging people that didn't agree with these values or thought their co-workers are not up to their expectations of character to leave, offering 4 months' severance. It's self-reported that less than 1% of people took up the offer.\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * If you don't define your own culture your employees will do it for you\n * Crypto advocacy from people that built projects at scale is a critical part of the globalisation of decentralised, borderless transactions\n\nDYOR\n\n * Jesse sits down with protocol to talk about its stance on anti-woke culture\n * Kraken announces departure of CEO via coindesk\n * Link to the \"Tentaclemandments\" Krakens' culture document\n\n\n💰👀 Funding\n\n\n👑 Magna raises $15m Seed Round to be the Carta for Crypto\n\nMagna raised $15m @ $70m valuation from Tiger Global and Tusk Venture Partners to focus on token distribution from token warrants and ESOP agreements.\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * Magna solves a key issue in web3 of token distribution and unlocks for projects\n * Having a globally accepted platform with audit-tested smart contracts is an important step in the trust and safety of on-chain investment\n * Bruno is one of those founders that continues to ship and is surrounding himself with a killer team\n\n\n💥 Limit Break comes out stealth raising $200m from Paradigm\n\nLimit Break has come out of stealth this week with a $200m raise from Paradigm. To pioneer a new form of Free to Own (F2O) games for web3.\n\nThey launched their first project Digidaikus as a free mint comprised of 2,022 anime-themed characters that currently have a floor price of 12eth with a 7.8k trading volume since mint.\n\nHow did a little unknown project raise $200m? I'll talk more about it in our company deep dive in part 2 of this Probably Nothing issue stay tuned! If you're not subscribed, it takes 5 seconds.\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * Co-founder Gabriel Leydon previously founded Machine Zone which sold to mobile advertising giant AppLovin for $500m\n * Limit Break plans to use the $200m exclusively for marketing and advertising purposes when they release their P2E game\n * Machine Zone is the creator of Game of War which at its peak generated $95m in monthly revenue\n\n\n🏔 Animoca raises $110m to fund its metaverse land grab\n\nThe $110m was led by Temasek, Boyu and GGV capital interesting for a round of this size it was completed as a convertible note at a price of $4.50.\n\nAnimoca has been on the rise as a leader in the crypto investing space after infamously being booted from the ASX in March 2020. Something that made penny traders millions in the delisting.\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * Animoca is a leader in web3 gaming investments betting big on virtual land sales\n * Animoca actively advocates for an open metaverse standard and invests accordingly\n * Animoca isn't shy to pay expensive prices for popular projects, heavily investing in YGG and Axie Infinity\n\n\n🛠 of the Week: WAGMI React hooks for Eth\n\nThe awesome tool of this week goes to WAGMI which provides you with react hooks for Ethereum which makes building frontends a breeze.\n\n * Connect Wallet\n * Sign Messages\n * Interact with contracts\n\nIt's all with caching, request deduplication and persistence and it works with ENS out of the box and supports all the popular wallet and RPC providers, no need to struggle with window.ethereum any longer!\n\nThe best part is the Docs are amazing and thorough so you don't get lost, even I could figure it out and start building quickly.\n\nIt's completely open source so check out the github repo.\n\nTo get started:\n\n\nnpm i wagmi ethers\n\n\n\nor use yarn if you're that person\n\nProbably Nothing?\n\n * MIT License\n * Used by ENS, Foundation, Sushiswap and more\n * The Docs!\n\n\nThe Merge\n\nWen Merge?

This week a New Zealand company called VeVe.\n\nDigital collectable marketplace VeVe launched in September 2021. It's the child of Singapore based parent company Ecomi. But don't be fooled it's very much a New Zealand company and its quietly been growing an impressive loyal fanbase with subtle web3 integrations.\n\nUsing immutascan we can get a picture of how well the company is doing as a whole.\n\n * 646,533 unique owners have a VeVe NFT\n * They mint between 10k-60k NFTs per week in blind box format with varying rarities\n * Collectibles mint at $7-$60 depending on the release\n * Royalties start 2.5% for standard NFT's + 8.5% for Marvel, Disney & DC\n * Currently you can only buy and cash out via USD (Fiat) with the later incurring a 10% fee.\n\nVeVe sells NFT versions of famous comic books and collectables from Disney, Marvel, Batman, Monster Hunter, NFLPA, DC Collectibles, Superman and more. Comics like Amazing Fantasy #015 the first appearance of Spiderman released on the platform last month with the secret rare edition (250 copies) fetching $20k on the secondary market.\n\n\nThe Vision & Team\n\nIt's 1999 you wake up at 7 am but before you go to school you grab your bowl of cereal and sit too uncomfortable close to the TV, you need to know what that yellow creature called Pikachu is up to this week.\n\nI probably described your childhood or your kids just now. That wouldn't have been possible without a company called 4kids which brought Pokemon and Yugioh to the west from japan and onto television in the late 90’s. Its founder Alfred Kahn is now the Head of licensing at VeVe. Additionally, David Yu and Daniel Crothers VeVe's co-founders probably played a role in how you were able to open a pack of Yugioh or Pokemon cards in the 90's if you lived in APAC. This team understands intellectual property partnerships.\n\nVeve takes this nostalgia and packages it up and sells in its digital collectibles with an insanely profitable blind box format (gacha).\n\n\nPlatform & Solution\n\nYou won’t find VeVe NFT’s on the Immutable marketplace, Opensea, Sudoswap or the likes. VeVe has taken a conservative approach to showcasing web3 features to its user base, operating a private orderbook on immutable's L2 blockchain. There is little mention of crypto or NFT’s in its marketing, favouring the term digital collectable and the majority of its volume happens on its mobile app through gems that can be purchased with Fiat currency.\n\nIt doesn’t feature any extensive interoperability as of yet, opting to hold NFT’s in custodial wallets for its users and enabling KYC for purchases to help alleviate bot problems for collectable drops and enable payouts off platform.\n\nThis drives a very smooth minting and collecting experience. Purchasing a comic from either the secondary marketplace or a primary release is delightful, including stocking up my wallet with gems. I have experienced several issues with 2FA and the browser application.\n\nIt also focuses heavily on another emerging industry Altered Reality (AR) allowing you to showcase your comics and collectables in digital vaults or read them on your table.\n\n\nBusiness Model\n\nVeve probably differs the most from current marketplaces solutions. Due to its choice to run a private order book and not feature extensive interoperability with custodial wallets, it can afford to charge high fees increasing its control as a distributor.\n\nSecondary Market Fees\n\n * 2.5% for standard collectables in addition to Licensor fees\n * 8.5% for Disney / Marvel / High profile IP\n\nPayouts\n\n * Must have at least $1000 gems in wallet ($1k USD)\n * No payouts over $50k in a 7 day period\n * 10% fee on payouts from their platform and only into USD\n\nCustodial Wallets\nWanting to make the platform as seamless as possible for web2 users it features custodial wallets for all its users, so its account is effectively a custodial wallet the user doesn't have direct access to in their order book on the immutable l2 chain.\n\nBlind Box Format\n\nThe core of Veve is its blind box format. Which standardizes the purchase \"mint\" price of its collectables to give you a chance of getting between a common to the secret rare version of a collectable.
